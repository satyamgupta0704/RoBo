# Robotics Education Platform

Welcome to the Robotics Education Platform! This project aims to provide an interactive platform for learning robotics concepts and programming through a simulated environment.

## Features

- Grid-based simulation of a robot's movement.
- Drag-and-drop interface to program the robot's movements.
- Play and reset buttons to execute and reset the robot's movements.
- Real-time visualization of the robot's position on the grid.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
- Cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- HTML5: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS3: Stylesheet language for styling the web page.
